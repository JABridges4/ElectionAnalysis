# ElectionAnalysis
## Overview
  I used Python to create a program to verify election results for a Congressional election in Colorado. The election took place in three different counties. The program found out how many votes each candidate got across all counties as well as the percentages in order to declare a winner. The program was then edited to include voter turnout information in each of the three counties.

  ## Election-Audit Summary
    This program worked very effectively and efficiently for this election, and I am confident that it could work for any election, with simple modifications. A potential modification would be to change county info to state info if this program were to be used for a national election. Another modification would be to calculate the voter turnout by the percentage of people in each county that voted. The only extra information required would be the number of eligible voters in each county.
